$$
Z = \int LdX = \int L(\theta)\pi(\theta)d\theta
$$
Prior mass $X$ can be accumulated from its elements $dX$ in any order, so define:


$$
X(\lambda) = \int_{L(\theta)>\lambda}\pi(\theta)d\theta
$$
as the cumulant prior mass covering all likelihood values greater than $\lambda$



Prior mass 就是先验的概率
